# UoB_BC_Code_Quiz

# Introduction
This piece of work was designed from scartch. The quiz needed to be started upon pressing a button, timed, able to remove time from the timer should a question be answered incorrectly, and able to store the scores of those that take the quiz.

## Why did I do this?
The idea was to build a quiz as a medium for revision/study. Also, it helped to clarify my understanding of event listeners, DOM manipulation, timers, nested if/else statements, and ternary operators.

### What I learnt
I wouldn't really say i learnt anything new throughout the process, more so i developed a deeper understanding of what i had already learnt.
Aside from tech-related knowledge i also managed to get a better understanding of how to better manage my time when doing these pieces of work (towards the end anyway).

#### For the future
I would like to come back at some point to finish off the project in it's entirety. As it stands i was not able to immplement the features to remove time should an answer be incorrect, or to record hiscores of those that play the quiz. 
I would also like to add more questions to the quiz, as of right now there are only 4 very easy questions.
